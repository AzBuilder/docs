# CI/CD Integration

If you need to manage your workspaces and execute Jobs from an external CI/CD tool you can use the [Terrakube API,  ](broken-reference)however a simple approach is to use the existing integrations:

| CI/CD tool   | Integration                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Github       |  [Github Action](github-actions.md)      |
| Bitbucket    |  [Bitbucket Pipe](bitbucket.md)          |
| Azure DevOps | Azure DevOps extension is in development |
