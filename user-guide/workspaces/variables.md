# Variables

Terrakube workspace variables let you customize configurations and store information like static provider credentials. You can also reference this variables inside your Templates.

You can set variables specifically for each workspace or you can create [global-variables.md](../organizations/global-variables.md "mention") to reuse the same variables across multiple workspaces.
