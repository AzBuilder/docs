# Action Types

Action Types define where an action will appear in Terrakube. Here is the list of supported types:

### Workspace/Action

The action will appear on the Workspace page, next to the Lock button. Actions are not limited to buttons, but this section is particularly suitable for adding various kinds of buttons. Use this type for actions that involves interaction with the Workspace

### Workspace/ResourceDrawer/Action

The action will appear for each resource when you click on a resource using the Overview Workspace page or the Visual State Diagram. Use this when an action applies to specific resources, such as restarting a VM or any actions that involve interaction with the resource. \

### Workspace/ResourceDrawer/Tab

The action will appear for each resource when you click on a resource using the Overview Workspace page or the Visual State Diagram. Use this when you want to display additional data for the resource, such as activity history, costs, metrics, and more.

For this type, the`Label` property will be used as the name of the Tab pane.
